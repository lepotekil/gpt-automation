Once upon a particularly curious afternoon, Alice found herself standing at the edge of a peculiar forest. The trees, tall and twisted, seemed to whisper to one another in a language she couldn’t quite comprehend. Above her, the sky was a patchwork of lavender and gold, as though painted by an artist with a penchant for mischief.

“I do believe this is the strangest place I’ve ever been,” Alice muttered to herself, adjusting the ribbon in her hair as she took a cautious step forward. The forest floor was soft, almost springy, and every step she took released a faint giggle from beneath her feet.

“What a ridiculous thing for the ground to do!” she exclaimed, crouching down to inspect it more closely. No sooner had she pressed her hand to the mossy surface than a small, round face popped up from the soil.

“Ridiculous?” the face said indignantly, its eyes blinking rapidly. “I’ll have you know I’ve been laughing for centuries! It’s excellent exercise, you know.”

Alice gasped, nearly falling backward. “I beg your pardon! I didn’t mean to offend,” she stammered, feeling quite flustered. “It’s just… well, where I come from, the ground doesn’t laugh.”

The little face squinted at her, as though trying to decide whether she was worth listening to. “And where, pray, might that be? Somewhere dreadfully boring, I should imagine.”

“Not boring at all!” Alice retorted. “It’s perfectly sensible, I’ll have you know. We walk on the ground, and it stays still, just as it should.”

The face let out a shrill peal of laughter that echoed through the forest. “Still! Oh, you poor thing. How do you ever manage to stay awake?”

Before Alice could respond, the face disappeared back into the ground, leaving her to wonder whether she’d imagined the whole thing. Shaking her head, she continued deeper into the forest, where the trees grew thicker and the air was filled with the scent of something sweet and utterly unfamiliar.

As she walked, she noticed a peculiar sign nailed to a tree. It read:

“This way to Nowhere. That way to Somewhere Else. Whichever way you go, you’ll wish you’d gone the other.”

“Well, that’s not very helpful at all,” Alice said aloud, frowning. She turned left, reasoning that it was as good a direction as any. But before she’d gone more than a few steps, she heard a rustling in the bushes. Out popped a rabbit—not the White Rabbit she’d met before, but a rather plump rabbit wearing an oversized hat and a monocle.

“Ah, there you are!” the rabbit said, sounding exasperated. “You’re late, you know.”

“Late for what?” Alice asked, thoroughly confused.

“For tea, of course!” the rabbit declared, as though it were the most obvious thing in the world. “The Mad Hatter and the March Hare have been waiting for ages. And between you and me, they’re not the most patient pair.”

Alice sighed. “I wasn’t planning on going to tea.”

“Not planning!” the rabbit cried, clutching his chest as though she’d just uttered the most scandalous thing imaginable. “But you must! It’s Tuesday! Everyone knows tea is mandatory on Tuesdays.”

Before Alice could argue, the rabbit grabbed her by the hand and whisked her off at an alarming speed. The forest blurred around her, and soon she found herself standing before a crooked table laden with teapots, cups, and cakes of every imaginable color and size. At one end of the table sat the Mad Hatter, his hat even taller and more absurd than she remembered. The March Hare was perched on a chair at the other end, busily stirring a cup of tea with what appeared to be a paintbrush.

“Welcome, welcome!” the Mad Hatter cried, leaping to his feet and tipping his hat in an exaggerated bow. “We were beginning to think you’d never arrive.”

“I wasn’t invited,” Alice said hesitantly, glancing nervously at the peculiar assortment of characters.
